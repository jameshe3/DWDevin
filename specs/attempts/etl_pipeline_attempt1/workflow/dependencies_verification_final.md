# Node Dependencies Verification

## Reference Workflow (workflow1) Dependencies


## Our ETL Pipeline Dependencies
- Extract Node -> Start Node
  - Type: Normal
  - Output reference: startnode
  - Container reference: Flow type with workflow UUID

- Transform Node -> Extract Node
  - Type: Normal
  - Output reference: extract_node
  - Container reference: Flow type with workflow UUID

- Load Node -> Transform Node
  - Type: Normal
  - Output reference: transform_node
  - Container reference: Flow type with workflow UUID

## Verification Results
✓ Dependencies structure matches workflow1's format
✓ All nodes have proper container references
✓ Dependencies chain is complete with no missing links
